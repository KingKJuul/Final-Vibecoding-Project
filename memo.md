# Implementation & Ethics Memo — Butter AI

**(Final Version for Submission)**

This memo explains how I approached building the Butter AI prototype for Phase 3, with a specific focus on how I used generative AI tools throughout the process and how I thought about the implications of those decisions. While the final deliverable is a marketing website rather than a fully functional application, the process of creating it required a combination of product thinking, rapid prototyping, and careful judgment about what AI should and shouldn’t do in this early stage of the concept. This memo covers the role of AI during development, the rationale behind the AI features in the prototype, the risks and tradeoffs that came up during the build, and what I learned about working with generative AI as a practical partner.

## 1. How I Actually Used AI While Building

Throughout this project, I relied primarily on two AI tools: Google AI Studio and ChatGPT. AI Studio acted as my main “vibe coding” environment, handling most of the hands-on coding, design scaffolding, and deployment steps. ChatGPT functioned as a complementary assistant—essentially a debugging partner, writing coach, and reasoning engine when something in AI Studio didn’t behave the way I expected.

AI Studio was especially helpful for generating the initial structure of the website. Instead of manually creating the React components, Tailwind styling, and routing logic from scratch, I used AI Studio prompts to produce the bones of the landing page, the navigation flow, and the chatbot integration. It also handled the deployment pipeline and GitHub connection, both of which were surprisingly smooth at first and then became trickier later on. When deployment broke or GitHub permissions got tangled, that’s where human judgment—and ChatGPT—became essential. I had to understand how AI Studio was binding repositories, diagnose why permissions errors were happening, and restructure my workflow accordingly. No model could autonomously fix those issues, so my manual understanding made the difference.

Beyond code generation, I also used AI for copywriting and design decisions. AI Studio drafted early versions of the hero section, the problem narrative, and the feature explanations. I iterated on those drafts by rewriting certain lines, removing jargon, tightening the message, and making sure the language matched the tone of a simple, founder-friendly website. I also manually reorganized the layout, shifting the hero section to the top, grouping feature-benefit pairs in a more logical order, and shortening text where the site felt cluttered. The AI was useful for producing raw material, but the final polish came from manually editing, trimming, and reorganizing.

Importantly, human judgment was essential anytime the AI-generated code or explanations conflicted with the visual hierarchy I wanted. AI tools often produce “correct” code that doesn’t quite match the intended feel of the product. I had to refine spacing, restructure sections, change component order, and ensure the site communicated a clean, uncluttered story. Even though generative AI accelerated development, the website only became coherent after a series of manual adjustments that tied everything together.

## 2. Why the AI Feature in My Product Looks the Way It Does

For this phase of the project, I chose to implement a simple AI-powered Q&A chatbot embedded in the marketing site. I specifically chose this feature because it supports a polished, non-intrusive user experience. Instead of forcing visitors to engage with AI immediately, the chatbot stays tucked away until clicked. This ensures that people only interact with the AI if they actually want to explore how Butter AI might explain churn or customer signals. It creates a clean experience that enhances the product story without overwhelming the page.

I deliberately simplified the website for practicality. Early drafts included a long “How Butter Uses AI” section as well as a detailed explanation of different AI capabilities, but these made the site feel heavy and distracted from the core story. Because this is a marketing-oriented prototype—not the functional version of Butter—I prioritized clarity over completeness. Removing extra technical sections kept the narrative crisp and focused.

While the chatbot does not directly demonstrate real churn scoring or customer segmentation, it still reinforces the core value proposition. Butter AI’s long-term purpose is to translate ambiguous customer behavior into actionable insight. The chatbot mirrors that concept at a small scale: it takes open-ended questions about churn and produces simple, digestible explanations. It is not connected to real customer data, and it cannot calculate health scores or detect signals—but it demonstrates the style of intelligence Butter will eventually embody. For a marketing prototype, that connection is enough.

## 3. Risks, Trade-offs, and Integrity

Even for a lightweight marketing website, I had to think through several AI-related risks, especially around privacy, fairness, and user trust. Although the chatbot does not process personal customer data in this prototype, I still designed it under the assumption that AI systems should avoid making statements that could be interpreted as professional, diagnostic, or business-critical guidance. The responses are intentionally high-level and educational. I did not want users to assume the AI was performing real predictive analytics or validating real customer scenarios. In a future version, privacy would become a major concern—customer data would have to be carefully protected and processed in a secure, compliant way.

I also considered bias and fairness, even though they are minimal concerns at this stage. The model could unintentionally reinforce unbalanced assumptions about customer behavior or suggest simplistic conclusions. By controlling tone and limiting the scope of responses, I aimed to prevent the chatbot from presenting itself as an authoritative analytics engine. AI doesn’t know the business context behind a founder’s customers, and I wanted to avoid creating a false sense of precision.

Over-reliance on AI was another consideration. I didn’t want the chatbot to be positioned as something founders should trust blindly. Trust needs to be earned over time through transparent data, consistent patterns, and real predictive accuracy—none of which this prototype actually implements. So I intentionally constrained the AI to general explanations only. The system never makes claims about specific churn scores, forecasts, or customer categories.

In terms of academic integrity, I made sure to use AI tools as development partners rather than substitutes for understanding. ChatGPT helped me understand problems and debug issues, but I was the one guiding architecture decisions, interpreting error messages, restructuring components, and connecting the product narrative. I used AI to accelerate the work, not to replace the work. That distinction felt important because AI can make it easy to turn off your brain and accept whatever it outputs. I tried to take the opposite approach and use it to think more critically about the product.

Finally, I made deliberate choices to limit what AI does in the prototype. I did not attempt to simulate real churn modeling, customer data ingestion, or advanced analytics. Including those features would likely mislead people into thinking Butter AI is further along than it truly is. Keeping the chatbot simple and educational was the most honest representation of what the product can do today.

## 4. What I Learned About Building with GenAI

This project significantly changed how I think about building software with generative AI. The biggest surprise was just how powerful these tools are at creating usable, production-ready scaffolding. Within minutes, I could generate a full landing page, a responsive layout, or a component-based design that would have taken hours by hand. But at the same time, I realized how important it is to understand the code behind the output. When small fixes or structural changes were needed, it became much faster to make the adjustments manually than to re-prompt the AI for every tweak. Knowing how to read and reason about the code made me far more effective than relying on GPT outputs alone.

If I were advising another founder, I would tell them to use AI to generate a strong base—something functional, clean, and close to what they want—but not to expect it to get every detail right. AI is incredible at hitting 80–90% of the problem. It’s the final 10–20% that still requires human intention, design judgment, and attention to product coherence.

This project also shifted how I think about my capstone and future ventures. I now feel much more confident in my ability to build early prototypes quickly and test ideas without needing a fully staffed engineering team. It dramatically lowers the barrier to exploring new concepts. In the future, I expect to apply these tools more aggressively when experimenting with product ideas, and I can see myself building lightweight MVPs far more often because of how easy it has become.

Overall, the experience reinforced that AI is a powerful accelerant—not a replacement—for real product thinking. It helps me move faster, but it still relies on me to make decisions about what to build, why it matters, and how to present it to users in a clear and responsible way.
